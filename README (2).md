## 📖 Introduction

Fake news on social media has significant implications for public opinion and democracy. This project utilizes NLP to detect and analyze fake news, providing a valuable tool for mitigating misinformation.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from News Dataset. It includes a variety of real and fake news articles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Text Vectorization:** TF-IDF

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of our model, we use the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision:** The ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives.
- **Recall:** The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## 📊 Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the validation set. Confusion matrices and accuracy scores are provided for deeper insight into model performance.
